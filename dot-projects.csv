Brooklyn,"DUMBO/Vinegar Hill Street & Plaza Reconstruction","NYC DOT is working with DDC, the DUMBO Improvement District, and the communities of DUMBO and Vinegar Hill to develop a design for a $20 million capital project to reconstruct cobble roadways and subsurface utilities on multiple blocks of DUMBO and Vinegar Hill and build out Pearl Plaza, a successful public space that NYC DOT and DUMBO Improvement District implemented in 2007 using temporary materials. The streets in the project area consist of granite cobbles, generally in poor condition, with some sections of asphalt. These conditions impede bicycles, are difficult for pedestrians and do not meet Americans with Disability Act (ADA) guidelines. At the same time, community members feel strongly about preserving the character of the neighborhood to the greatest extent possible. NYC DOT is committed to a design that restores all streets with granite cobble in a way that makes these streets available for all users, including cyclists. For the Pearl Plaza, the goal is to create a design responsive to community desires, which incorporates seating and landscape elements in a manner that is consistent with the context, and that provides maximum flexibility for programming. The plaza design will connect Pearl Plaza to an adjacent public space under the Manhattan Bridge Arch. This design project includes extensive community outreach, with three public workshops held as of March, 2013. Following a vigorous discussion about the cobble roadway design at a workshop in January, 2013, the designers incorporated neighborhood feedback and presented revised concepts at a workshop on March 20th. The project team then built granite cobble mock-ups which were viewed by approximately 50-60 members of the public. Based on public input, a presentation was made to the Community Board 2 executive board, which endorsed the project on July 22, 2013. The project design will be submitted and presented to the Landmarks Preservation Commission in September 2013"
